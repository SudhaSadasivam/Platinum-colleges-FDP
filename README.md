# Platinum-colleges-FDP
This repository is meant to collaborate with Platinum colleges Faculty

A simple walkthrough of a Machine Learning exercise, creating, evaluating, and deploying a Machine Learning model without writing a single line of code.

You will set up a free Watson Studio account, a web-based IDE for Machine Learning, Data Science, and Deep Learning.

You will import and transform a public dataset.

You will build 4 machine learning prediction models and evaluate for the best accuracy.

You will deploy the model with best accuracy as a web service fronted with an API to make predictions.

You will call the prediction model web service to make predictions.
